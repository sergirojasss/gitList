- About prerequisite "Do not use Storyboards or xib files", I tried, and I really mistaked everything, I never worked with swiftUI and I couldn't learn how to in the 4 to 6 hours of this project. To skip being completly blocked, I used a very simple storyboard.

- I developed this app trying to fit maximum of the goals in this 4 to 6 hours, knowing that I'll spend a lot of time trying to do some unit test. Never worked with tests, so, It'll take a while. So I'd like to spend more time on the other issues.

- Project structure: I don't remember 100% where to put all stuff. That's why I did some "layers". I tried a MVVM model, but I think I need someone to tell me exactly how to.

- Tests: I tried, but I prefer to not post anything rather post a copy-paste tutorial and don't event knowing if it's really testing. I never did testing and I want to learn, but here is not the project to.
